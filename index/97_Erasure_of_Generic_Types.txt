During the type erasure process, the Java compiler erases all type parameters and replaces each with its first bound if the type parameter is bounded, or Object if the type parameter is unbounded.
Consider the following generic class that represents a node in a singly linked list:
Because the type parameter T is unbounded, the Java compiler replaces it with Object:
In the following example, the generic Node class uses a bounded type parameter:
The Java compiler replaces the bounded type parameter T with the first bound class, Comparable:
