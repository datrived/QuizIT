There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type. For example, a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Number or its subclasses. This is what bounded type parameters are for.
To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameter's name, followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound, which in this example is Number. Note that, in this context, extends is used in a general sense to mean either "extends" (as in classes) or "implements" (as in interfaces).
By modifying our generic method to include this bounded type parameter, compilation will now fail, since our invocation of inspect still includes a String:
In addition to limiting the types you can use to instantiate a generic type, bounded type parameters allow you to invoke methods defined in the bounds:
The isEven method invokes the intValue method defined in the Integer class through n.
The preceding example illustrates the use of a type parameter with a single bound, but a type parameter can have multiple bounds:
A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. If one of the bounds is a class, it must be specified first. For example:
If bound A is not specified first, you get a compile-time error:
