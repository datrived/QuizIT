Frequently, a program ends up with numeric data in a string objecta value entered by the user, for example.
The Number subclasses that wrap primitive numeric types ( Byte, Integer, Double, Float, Long, and Short) each provide a class method named valueOf that converts a string to an object of that type. Here is an example, ValueOfDemo , that gets two strings from the command line, converts them to numbers, and performs arithmetic operations on the values:
The following is the output from the program when you use 4.5 and 87.2 for the command-line arguments:
Sometimes you need to convert a number to a string because you need to operate on the value in its string form. There are several easy ways to convert a number to a string:
or
Each of the Number subclasses includes a class method, toString(), that will convert its primitive type to a string. For example:
The ToStringDemo example uses the toString method to convert a number to a string. The program then uses some string methods to compute the number of digits before and after the decimal point:
The output of this program is:
