Look at the static method intValue:
Whitespace is required between private and static, between static and int, between int and intValue, and between String and data.
If the code is written like this:
...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type privatestaticint It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.
