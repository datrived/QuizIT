The following program, RegionMatchesDemo, uses the regionMatches method to search for a string within another string:
The output from this program is Eggs.
The program steps through the string referred to by searchMe one character at a time. For each character, the program calls the regionMatches method to determine whether the substring beginning with the current character matches the string the program is looking for.
